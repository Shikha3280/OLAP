# OLAP
Digital Ad Campaign Tracker
üìÑ Project Overview
This is a web-based Performance Management System (PMS) designed to track and manage Digital Ad Campaigns. Built with Python, the application offers a user-friendly interface for setting goals, logging tasks, tracking progress, providing feedback, and generating business insights. The application uses a two-file architecture, separating the front-end user interface from the back-end database operations for clarity and maintainability.

‚ú® Core Features
Goal & Task Setting: Managers can create and assign goals to employees. Employees can then log tasks to work toward these goals.

Progress Tracking: The system allows both managers and employees to monitor the progress of goals and tasks. Managers have the exclusive ability to update a goal's status.

Feedback: A dedicated section for managers to provide written feedback on specific goals. An automated feedback system is implemented using database triggers.

Reporting: A comprehensive reporting section provides a historical view of an employee's performance, including all past and present goals and feedback.

Business Insights: The system provides actionable insights using aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, AVERAGE, MIN, and MAX to analyze campaign performance.

üíª Technical Stack
Frontend: Streamlit

Backend: Python

Database: PostgreSQL

Database Connector: psycopg2

‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation
1. Prerequisites
Python 3.x: Ensure Python is installed on your system.

PostgreSQL: Install and set up a PostgreSQL database instance.

2. Database Configuration
Before running the application, you must create a database and update the connection details in the backend_pms.py file.

Create a new database named pms_db.

Open backend_pms.py and replace "your_username" and "your_password" with your PostgreSQL credentials.

3. Install Dependencies
Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the required Python libraries:

Bash

pip install streamlit psycopg2-binary
4. Run the Application
With the database configured and dependencies installed, you can start the application from your terminal:

Bash

streamlit run frontend_pms.py
The application will open in your web browser.

üìÅ Application Structure
The application is split into two distinct files to promote clarity and maintainability:

frontend_pms.py: Handles the entire user interface and interaction logic using the Streamlit library. It calls the functions from the backend_pms.py file to perform all database-related tasks.

backend_pms.py: Manages all connections to the PostgreSQL database. It contains functions for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, as well as functions for generating business insights.

üìä Database Schema
The following SQL queries are used to create the necessary tables for the application. The init_db() function in backend_pms.py will automatically run these if the tables do not exist.

SQL

-- Create the goals table
CREATE TABLE goals (
    goal_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    manager VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    employee VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    due_date DATE NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);

-- Create the tasks table
CREATE TABLE tasks (
    task_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    goal_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    due_date DATE NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'To Do',
    approval_status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'Pending',
    FOREIGN KEY (goal_id) REFERENCES goals (goal_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- Create the feedback table
CREATE TABLE feedback (
    feedback_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    goal_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    manager_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    feedback_text TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (goal_id) REFERENCES goals (goal_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
üîí CRUD & ACID Compliance Matrix
This matrix provides a comprehensive overview of how each major use case maintains data integrity and reliability by adhering to the principles of Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.
